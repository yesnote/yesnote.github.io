# A few more classification metrics... (to evaluate our classification model)

* Accuracy - out of 100 samples, how many does our model get right?
* Precision
* Recall 
* F1-score
* Confusion matrix
* Classification report

See this article for when to use precision/recall - https://towardsdatascience.com/beyond-accuracy-precision-and-recall-3da06bea9f6c

If you want access to a lot of PyTorch metrics, see TorchMetrics - https://torchmetrics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ 


```python
!pip install torchmetrics
```

```python
from torchmetrics import Accuracy

# Setup metric
torchmetric_accuracy = Accuracy().to(device)

# Calculuate accuracy
torchmetric_accuracy(y_preds, y_blob_test)
```




    tensor(0.9950, device='cuda:0')

--> Accuracy 말고도 torchmetrics에서 많은 metric 함수를 제공한다.


```python
torchmetric_accuracy.device
```




    device(type='cpu')
